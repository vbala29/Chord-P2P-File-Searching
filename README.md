<b> Inspiration: </b> The ideas in this project were originally implemented as the final project for the CIS5530 Networked Systems Class at the University of Pennsylvania (my partners including Ryan Oliver, Helen Rudoler, and Cassandra Horwege), but was only implemented in the [NS-3 network simulator](https://www.nsnam.org). However, I wanted to take this project and recreate it in the real world, where I could demonstrate its functionality on actual host machines (see youtube video for demostration).

<b>Technology:</b> This aplication was origina
A P2P (Peer to Peer) document sharing service that implements the Chord distributed hash table protocol. Clients run a multithreaded application (enabled by a custom thread pool library) to find and retrieve files with algorithmically gauranteed efficiency.
